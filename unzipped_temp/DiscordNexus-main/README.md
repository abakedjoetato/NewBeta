```

5. **Verify Status**

Check the deployment status in your Railway dashboard.

### Alternative Deployment Method

1. Fork this repository
2. Connect your Railway project to your GitHub repository
3. Railway will automatically detect the configuration and start the deployment
4. Set the required environment variables in the Railway dashboard
5. Your bot will automatically deploy and start running

## Configuration

The bot will use the environment variables set in Railway. Make sure all required variables are set before deployment.

## Monitoring

Monitor your bot's logs and performance in the Railway dashboard to ensure it's functioning correctly.

## Maintenance Tools

This bot includes maintenance utilities to help with troubleshooting and management:

### Restart Script

If you need to manually restart the bot, use:

```bash
./restart_bot.sh
```

This will terminate the current bot process and allow the workflow system to restart it automatically.

### Maintenance Utility

The `maintenance.py` script provides various utilities for maintaining and troubleshooting the bot:

```bash
# Show available commands
python maintenance.py help

# Restart the bot
python maintenance.py restart

# List all configured servers
python maintenance.py list_servers

# Run diagnostics on the database
python maintenance.py diagnose

# Fix type inconsistencies in the database
python maintenance.py fix_types

# Clear error states in the database
python maintenance.py clear_errors
```

### Type Handling

All channel IDs are stored as integers in the database and explicitly converted to integers before being used with Discord's API. This ensures consistent behavior across the application.
