# Server ID Type Handling Fixes

## Overview
This document summarizes the changes made to fix inconsistent server ID type handling across the codebase, particularly in the autocomplete functions. These fixes ensure that server IDs are consistently treated as strings throughout the application.

## Issues Addressed
1. Inconsistent type handling between server IDs in the database (mix of strings and integers)
2. Autocomplete functionality returning server IDs in different formats (strings vs integers)
3. Type comparison failures when IDs were stored as integers but compared as strings
4. Missing server_id_autocomplete reference in stats.py

## Files Modified

### cogs/stats.py
- Fixed server_id_autocomplete implementation
- Added explicit string conversion for all server IDs retrieved from autocomplete interactions
- Added debug logging to track type conversions
- Fixed indentation issues in the player_name_autocomplete and weapon_name_autocomplete functions
- Corrected log messages in weapon_name_autocomplete to properly identify the function

## Helper Scripts Created

### fix_autocomplete.py
- Automated fixes for type conversion in server_id extraction
- Adds debug logging for server ID type handling
- Ensures database queries use string comparison for server IDs

### fix_indent.py
- Fixes indentation issues in cogs/stats.py for server ID type handling code

### fix_weapon_autocomplete.py
- Updates log messages in weapon_name_autocomplete function to correctly identify the function

### fix_subcommand_log.py
- Fixes log messages in weapon_name_autocomplete function's subcommand handling

## Implementation Details

1. **Type Normalization**: Added explicit string conversion at all points where server IDs are extracted from interactions:
   ```python
   raw_id = option.get("value")
   server_id = str(raw_id) if raw_id is not None else None
   ```

2. **Debug Logging**: Added detailed logging to track type conversions:
   ```python
   logger.debug(f"Converting server_id from {type(raw_id).__name__} to string: {server_id}")
   ```

3. **Database Consistency**: Ensured database queries consistently use string comparisons for server IDs.

## Future Recommendations

1. Consider adding MongoDB schema validation to enforce consistent types for server IDs
2. Implement a centralized utility function for server ID normalization
3. Add unit tests to verify consistent type handling for server IDs
4. Consider using TypeScript-like type annotations and a static type checker like mypy
