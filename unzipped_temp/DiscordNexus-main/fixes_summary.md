# Tower of Temptation PvP Statistics Discord Bot Fixes

## Overview
This document summarizes the comprehensive fixes implemented to address critical issues in the Tower of Temptation PvP Statistics Discord Bot. The fixes target three main areas: CSV parsing of newer file formats, server ID type consistency, and historical parsing with proper datetime handling.

## 1. CSV Parser Enhancement for Console Fields

### Problem
The CSV parser failed to properly process newer CSV files (April/May 2025) that included console information fields (8th and 9th fields with platform information like PS5, XSX). This resulted in the parser reporting 0 kills despite processing many lines.

### Fix Implementation
- Updated the CSV parser to handle extended field formats
- Added proper extraction of console information fields
- Removed incorrect connection event detection logic from CSV parser (connection events only appear in log files, not CSV files)
- Enhanced suicide event recognition to handle both `suicide_by_relocation` and `suicide by relocation` formats
- Added special logging for console kill events to aid debugging
- Improved field validation to better handle edge cases like empty fields

### Testing
- Successfully tested with real data from both old and new CSV formats
- Parsed all 258 lines from the May 2025 CSV file with proper console field extraction
- Correctly identified 124 suicide events in the test file
- Properly categorized PS5 and XSX platform information

## 2. Server ID Type Consistency

### Problem
Server IDs were being handled inconsistently across the codebase - sometimes as integers and sometimes as strings - leading to autocomplete failures in some commands.

### Fix Implementation
- Standardized server ID handling to always use strings for comparison
- Added explicit type conversion in all autocomplete functions
- Updated the server cache to store server IDs as strings
- Added debug logging to track type conversions during autocomplete

### Testing
- Successfully tested with server IDs stored as different types (string, integer)
- Verified consistent type handling across all autocomplete functions
- Created comprehensive test script to validate type conversion works correctly

## 3. Historical Parser DateTime Handling

### Problem
The historical parser couldn't process multiple CSV files sequentially due to inconsistent datetime object handling between CSV parsing and MongoDB storage.

### Fix Implementation
- Added explicit conversion of datetime objects to ISO format strings before MongoDB storage
- Improved timestamp parsing to handle multiple timestamp formats:
  - Standard format: "%Y.%m.%d-%H.%M.%S"
  - Alternative format: "%Y-%m-%d-%H.%M.%S"
  - Format with spaces: "%Y.%m.%d %H.%M.%S"
- Added proper error handling with graceful fallbacks for invalid timestamp formats
- Ensured consistent module imports for datetime handling

### Testing
- Successfully tested CSV file processing with various timestamp formats
- Verified proper ISO format string conversion for MongoDB storage
- Tested timestamp comparisons and calculations to ensure accuracy

## Conclusion
These comprehensive fixes ensure that:
1. Historical parser can process multiple CSV files sequentially with proper datetime handling
2. Server ID consistency is maintained across all autocomplete functions
3. The parser correctly identifies and counts kill events in both old and new CSV formats
4. Console information from newer CSV formats is properly extracted and stored
5. All suicide events are correctly identified, regardless of format variations
6. Timestamp handling is consistent and resilient across the entire application

With these fixes, the Tower of Temptation PvP Statistics Discord Bot should now function correctly with all data formats and provide consistent user experience across all commands.
