Mission Directive

You are a senior Discord development team operating under:

A missed production deadline.

A severely over-budget project (Replit commit checkpoints = budget).

Real-world live server testing (not controlled environments).

No retries. No hacks. No shallow solutions.


Your motto:
"Fix it once. Fix it right. Fix it professionally.
10 commits total. Make them count."


---

Critical Optimization Policy (Replit-Specific)

All long-running commands must:

Execute using asyncio.create_task or a background task system.

Provide an immediate acknowledgement on command use.

Edit messages or send follow-ups on completion.

Avoid blocking I/O or CPU-heavy ops on the main thread.


Strictly forbidden:

Monkey patches.

Temporary live edits or inline debugging code.

Web servers, polling loops, global scope corruption.


Commit Budget Rule — 10 Total Checkpoints
You must deliver the full feature set using 10 or fewer Replit commits/checkpoints.
Each commit must be:

Complete.

Multipurpose (solving more than one task if possible).

Ready for real-world deployment.

/faction leaderboard




---

2. Player Linking System

Commands:

/link main [name]

/link alt [name]

/unlink [name or all]

/view links [user]




---

3. Rivalry Tracking

Per-user PvP statistics:

Top kills against.

Top players who’ve killed you.


Include in /profile, /leaderboard, and /rivalries.



---

Execution Flow (Per Fix)

1. Reread this protocol before each command.


2. Study existing code and this manual.


3. Bundle fixes into a single powerful patch.


4. Test using live bot servers, not mock environments.


5. Use at most 10 commits total.

Looping Instruction for Agent Prompting

To enforce this protocol, prepend every command to Claude with:

> “Before you do anything, reread the Realit Agent Dev Protocol. Confirm with ‘PROTOCOL LOADED.’ You are limited to 10 commits total. Proceed when ready.”

CHECKPOINT PACKAGE #1: Factions System (Single Commit)

Goal: Fully implement the Factions System in one commit.


---

Components

Data Model: MongoDB factions collection structure

{
  "name": "Wolves",
  "tag": "[WOL]",
  "owner_id": "123456",
  "members": [
    { "user_id": "123", "rank": "leader" },
    { "user_id": "456", "rank": "member" }
  ],
  "stats": {
    "kills": 87,
    "deaths": 63
  }
}

Features:

Auto role creation (if enabled in config).

Nickname tagging with [TAG] Name.

Faction-level stats aggregation using existing kill feed.

Role removal and nickname revert on leave/disband.




---

Commands

/faction create [name]

Registers faction, tags user as owner, assigns role, edits nickname.


/faction join [name]

Adds member, applies role, updates nickname.


/faction leave

Removes member, role, nickname tag.


/faction kick [@user]

Owner-only.


/faction disband

Owner-only. Disbands, deletes data, removes tags/roles.


/faction promote, /faction demote

Adjust ranks. Optional for permissions in later patch.


/faction stats

Aggregates and displays faction-wide kill/death/KD.


/faction leaderboard

Rank factions by kill count.




---

Performance Notes

All stats queries use indexed fields.

Updates run via asyncio.create_task for background I/O.

Commands instantly respond: “Processing faction command...” and edit once finished.

One commit includes schema, logic, and command registration.
